## About
The collectors are installed on your application instances (VMs or containerized environments) and mirror the service interactions & metrics back to Netsil AOC for real-time analysis.

You *do not* need to install the collectors in the same environment where you installed the AOC.
For instance, you may run the AOC as a standalone docker container, but install the collectors in Kubernetes, if you wish.
